# CIS4282_LoginTutorial

This project was developed for an Independent Study under Professor Sally Kyvernitis http://cis-linux2.temple.edu/~sallyk/#/Node

I used Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The functionality includes a full CRUD application with logon, logout, and view profile pages.
